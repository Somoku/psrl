"""
Unit tests for PSManager broadcast_init integration.

Tests cover:
1. TestCoordinateBroadcastInit — _coordinate_broadcast_init builds plan internally and
   drives the broadcast loop correctly.
2. TestBindPsWorkerGroupBroadcast — bind_ps_worker_group registers PS agent names on
   MetaServer when broadcast_init is enabled.
