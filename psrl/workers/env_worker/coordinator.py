"""
Sandbox routing and capacity accounting.

The coordinator is deliberately thin. It knows which workers exist, how loaded
they are, and how to choose one for a `SandboxSpec`. Container mechanics live in
`EnvWorker`, and placement decisions live in `EnvWorkerManager`. Keeping routing
here is what allows locality-aware or dynamic policies to be added later without
touching either neighbor.
